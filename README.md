## Git Collaboration
Practical tasks for me were much more useful than video lessons. At first it was a little confusing, but with a little practice everything became clear) All commands are very useful and I will use them in my work in the  future.

In my practice, I use flexbox more often then Grid, for me it is a more convenient tool. Remembered the nuances of creating a Css Grid.Really liked the practice games;))))
